## How it works

Every other week, you can jump on a group video chat with JavaScript expert Chris&nbsp;Ferdinandi.

Ask questions, share ideas, and get feedback in a friendly, welcoming environment. The format is an unstructured Q&A/AMA. You can join live and ask questions, or just sit back and listen to the conversation.

If you can't make a call in real-time, you can submit questions in advance and watch a recording later. You'll also get access to an archive of previous office hours.

*Vanilla JS Office Hours are an open-ended, monthly subscription service.*

You **get exclusive access to a private Slack channel** just for office hours members. You can chat with other students, get feedback on code, and ask questions in&#8209;between sessions.

This is not available for sale at any price, and my students regularly tell me it's one of the most valuable things I offer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

When are office hours held?
: Office hours are held every other Thursday at 1pm US Eastern. They're recorded for people who can't attend, and you can submit questions ahead of time if you can't make it.

What if I'm in a different timezone?
: I want to accommodate as many people as possible, and the current day and time covers as many timezones as possible.<br><br>That said, I understand that it doesn't work for everyone. If you can’t join live, your best options is to submit questions in advance and watch the recorded reply when it’s convenient.

Will all of my questions get answered?
: Yes. I’ll keep answering as long as it takes to get through everyone’s questions. If sessions are regularly going over 60 minutes, I’ll add sessions to accommodate demand.

Are office hours private?
: No. There will be many people joining you live on the session and many more will potentially viewing the recording later. If you need to share private information with me, private mentoring is a better option.

Do you offer a student discount?
: Absolutely! This applies to anyone in any type of schooling, including evening classes and coding bootcamps. [Learn more about student discounts.](/student-discount/)

I have a poor exchange rate in USD. There's no way I can afford this.
: I totally get that in some countries salaries and cost of living are such that the Vanilla JS Academy is unaffordable. Send me an email at {{<email params="subject=Office%20Hours:%20Exchange%20Rate&body=I%20live%20in%20a%20{country}.%20Can%20I%20have%20a%20discount%20to%20make%20Office%20Hours%20more%20affordable%20for%20me?%20Thanks!">}} and I'll send you a discount to make it fair for where you live.

I'm not a student. Any other discounts?
: Yep. I've had a lot of helping getting where I am, and I want to pay it forward. If you're a member of an under-represented group in tech, you can get special pricing. [Learn more about discounts for under-represented groups in tech.](/underrepresented-group-discount/)

Do you have a refund policy?
: Absolutely! If you’re not 100% satisfied with Vanilla JS Office H ours, email me at {{<email params="subject=Office20Hours:%20Refund%20Request">}} at any time, and you’ll get a full refund for that month.
